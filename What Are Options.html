		<h3> What Are Options? </h3>
		<p> - A simple definition of an option is that it is a contract that allows buyers to buy or sell a security at a chosen price. When you buy an option contract you buy 100 shares at a reduced price and every cent the underlying stock moves, the price of your contract moves as well. </p>
		<p> - Options are divided into "calls" and "puts." </p> 
		<p> A put option is where the buyer has the right to sell the underlying stock in the future at a predetermined price. A buyer would want to purchase a put option when they believe that the price of the stock is going to go down in the future and they would earn a profit when they sell the option at the predetermined price because the price of the underlying stock has dropped. </p> 
		<p> A call option is where the buyer has the right to buy the stock in the future at a predetermined price. A buyer would want to purchase a call option when they believe that the price of a stock is going to go up in the future. </p>
